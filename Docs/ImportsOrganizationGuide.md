Organizing imports based on the suggested folder structure is an important aspect of maintaining a clean and readable codebase. Here's a guide on how to organize the imports, using the folder structure we have set up:

```python
# In app/main.py

# Standard library imports
import os
from typing import List

# Third-party imports
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Local application imports
from app.api import locations, trips, drivers
from app.config import Settings
from app.models.location import Location
from app.services.location_service import LocationService
from app.utils.location_generator import generate_predefined_locations

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Include routers
app.include_router(locations.router)
app.include_router(trips.router)
app.include_router(drivers.router)

# Initialize services
location_service = LocationService(generate_predefined_locations())

# Example of a route in app/api/locations.py

# Standard library imports
from typing import List

# Third-party imports
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException

# Local application imports
from app.models.location import Location
from app.services.location_service import LocationService

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/locations", response_model=List[Location])
async def get_locations(location_service: LocationService):
    return location_service.get_all_locations()

```

Here are the key principles for organizing imports:

1. Group imports into three main categories:
   - Standard library imports
   - Third-party imports
   - Local application imports

2. Within each group, sort imports alphabetically.

3. Use absolute imports for the local application modules. This means always importing from the top-level package (app in this case).

4. Avoid using wildcard imports (`from module import *`) as they can lead to namespace pollution.

5. If you're importing multiple items from a single module, consider using multi-line imports for better readability.

Here's how you would apply these principles in different parts of the application:

1. In `app/main.py`:
   - Import the API routers from `app.api`
   - Import the config from `app.config`
   - Import any models or services you need directly

2. In API route files (e.g., `app/api/locations.py`):
   - Import the necessary FastAPI components
   - Import the relevant models from `app.models`
   - Import the relevant services from `app.services`

3. In service files (e.g., `app/services/location_service.py`):
   - Import any necessary standard library modules
   - Import the models from `app.models`
   - Import any utilities you need from `app.utils`

4. In model files (e.g., `app/models/location.py`):
   - These will typically just need standard library imports and possibly some from Pydantic if you're using it for data validation

Here's an example of how you might organize imports in the `LocationService`:

```python
# app/services/location_service.py

from typing import List, Optional
from uuid import UUID

from app.models.location import Location
from app.utils.location_generator import generate_predefined_locations

class LocationService:
    def __init__(self, locations: List[Location]):
        self._locations = locations

    def get_all_locations(self) -> List[Location]:
        return self._locations

    def get_location_by_id(self, location_id: UUID) -> Optional[Location]:
        return next((loc for loc in self._locations if loc.id == location_id), None)
```

By following these principles, the imports will be organized, readable, and maintainable. This approach also helps prevent circular imports and makes it clear where each imported item is coming from.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of import organization or apply this to a particular file in the project?
